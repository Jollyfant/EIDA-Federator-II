* Requests are resolved to the stream level (dataselect)
* Data requests can be run in parallel
* Streams webservice responses and runs entirely in memory
* Dataselect request splitting for large requests
* Simple request bundling to increase performance
* First mSEED record of each request is removed (It's a feature üêõ)
